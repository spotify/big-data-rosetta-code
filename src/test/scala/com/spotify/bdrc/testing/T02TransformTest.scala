/**
 * Test pipeline transforms
 *
 * Pros:
 * - Break down complex pipelines into smaller reusable pieces
 * - Easier to handcraft input and expected data than end-to-end test
 *
 * Cons:
 * - Does not cover argument parsing and IO handling
 * - May disrupt pipeline logic flow if overused
 *
 * Supported in: Scalding, Scio, Spark
 *
 * Recommendation:
 * Complex pipelines can be broken into logical blocks and tested using this approach. Individual
 * transforms should have clear roles in the pipeline, e.g. parsing input, formatting output,
 * aggregating data, training model, predicting labels, etc. It should also be easy to craft input
 * and expected data for these transforms and cover all code bases and edge cases.
 *
 * The level of granularity of each transform is also important. A transform should be small enough
 * for readability but big enough to avoid disruption to the main pipeline flow. Things to
 * consider are: number of inputs and outputs, group or join operations, etc.
