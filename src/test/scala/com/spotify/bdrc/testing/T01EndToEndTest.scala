/**
 * Test an entire pipeline end-to-end
 *
 * Pros:
 * - Complete test of the entire pipeline
 * - Covers argument parsing and I/O handling
 * - May also reveal serialization issues
 *
 * Cons:
 * - Hard to handcraft input and expected data
 * - Hard to cover edge cases for complex pipelines
 * - Can be slow in some frameworks
 *
 * Supported in: Scalding, Scio
 *
 * Recommendation:
 * This is a good approach to test small and simple pipelines since it offers the best code
 * coverage. It can also be used for pipelines with complex argument parsing and I/O handling,
 * e.g. ones with dynamic I/O based on arguments.
 *
 * Very complex pipelines with lots of steps may be broken down into smaller logical blocks and
 * tested separately using the transform test approach.
